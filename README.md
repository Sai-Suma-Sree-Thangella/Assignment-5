When compared to SVM, Naive Bayes gave better results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
The SVM could not produce improved results because the data only had six classifiers and was not sent into the higher dimension.
If the kernel option had been used to send the data, SVM would have produced superior results.
In summary, if forced to select between naive bayes and plain SVM, naive bayes would be the preferable option.
